                What Is Aphasia?
            </summary>
            <p>
                Aphasia is a disorder that results from damage to portions of the brain
                that are responsible for language. For most people, these areas are on the
                left side of the brain. Aphasia usually occurs suddenly, often following
                a stroke or head injury, but it may also develop slowly, as the result of
                a brain tumor or a progressive neurological disease. The disorder impairs
                the expression and understanding of language as well as reading and writing.
                Aphasia may co-occur with speech disorders, such as dysarthria or apraxia of
                speech, which also result from brain damage.

                There are 3 types of aphasias: Broca’s Aphasia, Wernicke’s Aphasia, and Global Aphasia.

                    In general, Broca’s Aphasia patients understand what other people are saying but have
                    much trouble <b><i>expressing</i></b> themselves to other people. Consequently, Broca’s
                    Aphasia is sometimes called “non-fluent aphasia” or “expressive aphasia.”

                        Broca’s Aphasia is caused by injury to the frontal regions of the left hemisphere,
                        which is the area of the brain that is believed to impact how words are strung
                        together to form complete sentences.

                    <p>
                        In 1861, a French neurosurgeon named Paul Broca examined the brain of a recently
                        deceased patient who had had an unusual disorder. Though the patient had been able
                        to understand spoken language and did not have any motor impairments of the mouth
                        or tongue that might have affected his ability to speak, he could neither speak
                        a complete sentence nor express his thoughts in writing. The only articulate sound
                        he could make was the syllable “tan,” which had come to be used as his name.

                    In general, Wernicke’s Aphasia patients, unlike Broca's Aphasia, talk in fluent gibberish
                    and have trouble <b><i>understanding</i></b> what other people are saying. Consequently,
                    Wernicke’s Aphasia is sometimes called “fluent aphasia” or “receptive aphasia.”

                        Ten years after Paul Broca’s discovery, a German neurologist named Carl Wernicke
                        discovered another part of the brain that he found was involved in
                        <b><i>understanding</i></b> language.

                    In general, Global Aphasia patients have trouble producing and understanding words, and they
                    often can’t read or write. Like Broca's and Wernicke’s Aphasias, Global Aphasia is typically
                    caused by stroke, head injury, or brain tumor.

                    You may self-diagnose whether you have any degree of any of Broca’s, Wernicke’s, or Global
                    Aphasia by referencing the lists of symptoms described above. Alternatively, the best way
                    to find out is to go to a doctor. Your doctor will give you a physical and a neurological
                    exam, test your strength, feeling and reflexes, and listen to your heart and the vessels
                    in your neck. In addition, your doctor will likely request an MRI test for you in order to
                    quickly identify the underlying neurological cause for your aphasia, if you do have one.

                    Communicating via the visual and sensory channels is just as important as, if not more
                    important than, communicating via solely the language channel when it comes to establishing
                    effective communications with aphasia patients. For example, you can communicate with such
                    patients using drawings, body languages, or even writings (e.g., flashcards with yes/no
                    questions). But above all, don’t “talk down” to aphasia patients! Give them time to organize
                    their thoughts and speak. Resist the urge to complete their sentences for them. Be patient!

                    Yes. Aphasia tends to be progressive, where a patient may first lose the ability to speak
                    and write, and gradually and eventually, lose the ability to understand spokeen and written
                    languages.

                <p>
                    Yes, but only to an extent. Aphasia patients are like stroke patients, in the sense that
                    both kinds of patients try to express themselves despite their disability. Aphasia has no
                    cure, but patients may still improve over time, especially through speech therapy.
